# React Native Stripe Starter Pack

Coaching Call by Ben Carter

## Getting Started

I have made a starter pack to make things easier for you! This starter pack includes Tailwind CSS installed (to make styling quicker as it is not the point of the coaching call), Environment Variables already set up so that they will be ready to use when we add Stripe, and some dummy products so that we have something to pay for.

#### Quick Note: If you do not already have Git installed, you can install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will need it to get started with this starter pack.

#### To get started with the starter pack, all you need to do is follow these steps:

First, install the Expo CLI if you have not already. You may need to put **sudo** infront of the command if you are on Mac or Linux (or using WSL on windows):

```bash
# NPM
npm i -g expo-cli

# Yarn
yarn global add expo-cli

# PNPM
pnpm i -g expo-cli
```

Next, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b3nc4r12/rn-stripe-starter-pack.git
```

Once you have done this, cd into the project:

```bash
cd rn-stripe-starter-pack
```

And install the dependencies:

```bash
# NPM
npm install

# Yarn
yarn install

# PNPM
pnpm install
```

It's that simple! You are now ready to start this demo!
