# React Native Stripe Starter Pack

Coaching Call by Ben Carter

## Getting Started

I have made a starter pack to make things easier for you! This starter pack includes Tailwind CSS installed (to make styling quicker as it is not the point of the coaching call), Environment Variables already set up so that they will be ready to use when we add Stripe, and some dummy products so that we have something to pay for.

#### Quick Note: If you do not already have Yarn installed, you can install it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). I am not sure if this starter pack will work with with npm.

To get started with the starter pack, all you need to do is clone this repo using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b3nc4r12/rn-stripe-starter-pack.git
```

Once you have done this, cd into the project:

```bash
cd rn-stripe-starter-pack
```

And install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

It's that simple! You are now ready to start this demo!
